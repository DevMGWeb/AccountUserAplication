# Account User Aplication

It is an application project where I show how to code a registration, login, create a user account using identity tools with EntityFrameworkCore using cookies, notifications and security.

Also in this project I show how I use automapper library, data annotations, customize validations, helpers for pasoword encryption, get user info, send email, model driven automapper, controller helper for better definition of control by separating management rols between class.

Among the programming languages or technologies used in this project i use are 
.NET CORE with C#, Javascript, JQuery, ORM Entity Framework Core (with is connected SQL Server), Arquicture MVC.
